## Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz (Module 4)
The purpose of this challenge was to create a quiz that asked questions, and store the scores of the quiz within local storage.

## Installation:
In order to access the files needed to complete the challenge see: https://github.com/BrennanJLM/code-quiz and clone either the following HTTPS link or SSH key:
HTTPS Link: https://github.com/BrennanJLM/code-quiz.git
SSH Key: git@github.com:BrennanJLM/password-generator.git
In order to clone the project to a "projects" directory, open your terminal (mac) or gitbash (windows) window and type the following commands into your terminal/gitbash command line:
1 - mkdir projects
2 - cd ./projects (You can use the command "pwd" to ensure you are in the correct directory)
3 - git clone <HTTPS link> OR git clone <SSH Key>
4 - ls (this will list all of the files now inside of the current directory)
Open your coding software, select "open file" and locate the module-3-challenge file in your projects directory OR find the correct file in your directory and "Open With" your coding software.

## Usage
- This website's main purpose is to serve as a quiz for users to use to answer randomized questions. The user will:
- Be presented with a series of randomized questions to answer
- Answer the question via multiple choice answers
- If right, there is no penalty
- If wrong there is a 10 second penalty
- Game ends when all questions are answered, or the clock reaches zero
- When the game ends it prompts you to enter your initials
- The page then stores the score, and initial within local storage
- The scores are then loaded from local storage, to a leaderboard
